trac-foundation-theme
=====================

Trac Theme for adding the Foundation 3.1 front-end framework to your trac environment.

Easy to get started - just clone the project, place the stylesheets/app.css file into trac_env/httpd/stylesheets
 place the templates/theme.html file into your trac_env/templates directory.
 
 Download Foundations 3.1 and copy the javascripts and images directory into the trac_env/httpd directory.  
 Copy the foundation.css directory into the trac_env/httpd/stylesheets directory.
 
 Restart your trac instance and you're should be working.
 
 For a quick start, it's looking good. There is still some stuff to do....but, fully functional.  I started with the
 chevah / trac-bootstrap-theme and made my initial modifications from there.  Thanks to that project for getting things
 rolling.
